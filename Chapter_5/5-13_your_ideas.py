# I have a few ideas I would love to explore:
# 
# Build a 2d game like some of the ones I played as a kid - bounce, space escape,
# snake etc
# 
# working with files - i would create a python script that sorts and arranges all 
# files in this directory to sub-directories based on suffices. so files 5* all go
# into a folder called Chapter-5. etc
#
# i want to create databases, read, delete, and updata data in them as well.
